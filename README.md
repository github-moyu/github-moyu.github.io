# Research interests
Coastal ecosystems are vital for climate risk mitigation and adaptation, yet these ecosystems themselves are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. My research centres on the question: **How does the resilience of these ecosystems to climate change affect their functioning under such pressures?** I am also passionate about developing new Earth and data science methodologies to deepen our understanding of coastal ecosystem dynamics and their functions at regional and global scales.

By integrating satellite imagery, climate data, and machine learning algorithms, the research aims to enhance our understanding of storm-induced damages and inform strategies for mangrove resilience. The project is funded by the prestigious Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellowship (2022-2024). [Find out more](https://github.com/moyu-ENV/CoastNet)

Combining satellite-based nighttime light observations, global electricity network databases, and historical and climate projections, this work assesses the **intensity and duration** caused by storms. The research aims to identify high-risk areas and inform strategies to bolster the resilience of electricity networks worldwide. This work received funding from  NERC and the Oxford John Fell Fund.
