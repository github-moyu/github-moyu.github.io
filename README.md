# Research Interests
I am excited pushing the boundaries of coastal ecology, Earth science, and data science to better understand coastal resilience to storms, and the role of coastal ecosystems can play as nature-based solutions in climate-resilient development. I am committed to practice-oriented and research-lead teaching to inspire the next generation of talents in environmental studies, and to engaging with stakeholders and the public to promote sustainable coastal development practices.
