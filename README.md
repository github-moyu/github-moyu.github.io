# Research Interests
I study coastal ecosystems as natural solutions for mitigating climate risks and supporting adaptation, even as these ecosystems themselves face significant climate change stresses. My work focuses on developing advanced Earth and data science techniques to analyze ecosystem dynamics and functions on a global scale.
