# Research interests
Coastal ecosystems are vital for climate risk mitigation and adaptation, yet these ecosystems themselves are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. My research centres on the question: **How does the resilience of these ecosystems to climate change affect their functioning under such pressures?** I am also passionate about developing new Earth and data science methodologies to deepen our understanding of coastal ecosystem dynamics and their functions at regional and global scales.

# Projects
<img align="left" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/12433/12433416.png" width="180" height="180" alt="image" />**CoastNet** leverages machine learning to assess and quantify the impact of storm events on mangrove forests worldwide. By integrating satellite imagery, climate data, and ecological insights, the research aims to enhance our understanding of storm-induced damages and inform strategies for mangrove conservation and resilience. The project is funded by the prestigious Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellowship (2022-2024). [Find out more](https://github.com/moyu-ENV/CoastNet)

<img align="right" src="https://sos.noaa.gov/ftp_mirror/land/earth_night/2012/media/thumbnail_big.jpg" width="180" height="180" alt="image" /> **Storm damage to global electricity network** investigates the vulnerability of electricity infrastructure in coastal cities to intensifying storms driven by climate change. Combining advanced modeling, historical storm data, and climate projections, the research aims to identify high-risk areas and develop strategies to enhance the resilience of energy networks. This work received funding from  NERC and the Oxford John Fell Fund. [Find out more](https://github.com/moyu-ENV/powerOutageNL)

By analyzing long-term data, it investigates the impacts of climate change and catastrophic events on the phenology of these vital ecosystems. This research provides key insights into how coastal marshes respond to environmental stressors, informing strategies for their conservation and management.
